Color use map

comparing and swapping 2 rectangles:
- correct mutual order - green
- wrong mutual order - red (swapping)

after quicksort step:
- lower than pivot - green
- pivot - orange
- bigger than pivot - red
(so you can see witch sublist is processing)

after mergesort step:
- also is used comparing (above)
- left list - green
- right list - red
(so after merge you can see where they came from)
